How to seperate a split gui file using gthumb and imagemagick

1. Download the file with the splits
  This is a file with the menu box split into a 3x3, separated by transparent
  space.

2. Use gthumb to crop the 3x3 box
  Open gthumb and open the edit tools with 'e' or by pressing the brush icon in
  the top right. Manually crop the image, and save it as a new file with a
  suitable name.
  Crop the image so that there will not be anything cut off when the image is
  split into a 3x3 by eye-balling the grid in the crop tool.

3. Use imagemagick to split the file into 9 separate files
  Create a directory for the file output.
  Use the following command to split the file into 9 equal parts and put the
  output in the newly created directory:
    magick <filename>.ext -crop 3x3@ <output_dir>/<filename>.ext
  for example:
    magick dark_menu_gui.png -crop 3x3@ dark_menu_3x3/dark_menu_gui.png
  This will create new files with the names dark_menu_gui-0.png,
  dark_menu_gui-1.png, etc., in the dark_menu_3x3 directory.

4. Use imagemagick to trim the 9 new files
  Use the following command to trim the remaining transparent space around the
  files:
    magick <directory>/<filename>.ext -trim <directory>/filename.ext
  for example:
    magick dark_menu_3x3/dark_menu_gui-*.png -trim \
      dark_menu_3x3/dark_menu_gui-*.png
  NOTE: This will only work if the menu texture itself does not use transparent
  space near its border areas.
