# dungeon-copy
This project is a videogame implemation of a popular d20 game system. At first the project began as a clone of CiderSlime/dungeon-quest, but has significantly deviated from dungeon-quest as I've worked on it more.

While the project is currently still a work in progress, you may find a write-up of my implementation of the attack system, using an event-driven system for concurrency using Bevy, at the following ReadMe: https://github.com/josephleblanc/dungeon-copy/blob/main/src/plugins/combat/attack/README.md

A copy of CiderSlime/dungeon-quest I'm building up to learn rust and bevy
