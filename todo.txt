Add animation states for players/creatures
When adding animation states,
1.) Update the Enum AnimationState in src/resources/animation_state.rs
2.) For players, update PlayerAnimation::new with the correct animation_timer.
    The animations currently use 0.1 seconds of delay between animation frames,
    but this can be changed as seems natural for the animation.
